In this API, we will have:
- token-bucket rate limiter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket#Algorithm
- Global rate limiting
- extend global rate limiter to support per-client limiting(IP based)
- configure the rate limiter, including disabling it for testing 

Token Bucket limiter:
- A limiter controls how frequently events are allowed to happen. It implements a 
  "token bucket" of size b, initially full and refilled at rate r tokens per second

- We will have a bucket that starts with b tokens in it
- Each time we receive a HTTP request, we will remove one token from it
- Every 1/r seconds, a token is added back to the bucket, (max b tokens)
- If we receive a request and bucket is empty, it means limit has been reached
- MEANING: our api will allow a max "burst" of b requests in quick succession but 
  over time it will allow an average of r requests per second
