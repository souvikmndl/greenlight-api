JSON Decode() error using NewDecoder() from json/encoding

- json.SyntexError, io.ErrEnexptedEOF --> syntax error with the JSON payload
- json.UnmarshalTypeError --> a JSON value is not appropriate for the destination Go type 
- json.InvalidUnmarshalError --> err in app code, possibly because the destination is not a pointer
- io.EOF --> JSON being decoded in empty

Migrations:
- migrate to next version
  migrate -path=./migrations -database=$GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN up
- migrate to a specific version 
  migrate -path=./migrations -database=$GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN version 
- migrate up or down to a specific version
  migrate -path=./migrations -database=$GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN goto 1
- rollback by a specific number of migrations 
  migrate -path=./migrations -database=$GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN down 1
- When migration error happens:
    - investigate where it went wrong, check if partial updates were applied
    - if yes, manually roll back the partial migration 
    - then force the version number in schema_migrations table to correct value
    - eg, to force the version numjber to 1:
    - migrate -path=./migrations -database=$EXAMPLE_DSN force 1
- running migrations from remote sources like S3:
  - migrate - source="s3://<bucket>/<path>" -database=$EXAMPLE_DSN up
------------------------------

Data Race Conditions:
- when two users try to update the same resource at exactly the same time, we run
  into a data race condition. To tackle this, we can use a simple version(int) check
  in our update query, like we have in our update query where we are specifying that
  update must happen only when the version matches. Using an integer field is safe
  and computationally light. Other options are:
    - last_updated_timestamp: there are many problems with this including server's clock
    malfunctioning
    - uuid: high entropy uuid can handle this well without revealing the version to the user

--------Read Managing SQL Query Timeouts---------------
- the timeout starts from the moment you create the context
- the Postgres driver has channels that communicate with the database
- when timeout is reached, even mid query, a signal is sent via the channel
- and we get this error message: "pq: canceling statement due to user request"
- it is due to user request because our API is using the db and the API itself
  has asked for the query to be terminated
- it can also happen that while Scan() is called, to read the data into the
  variables, the ctx deadline is reached. In that case we get "context deadline exceeded"

Embedding:
- allows us to store files in the compiled binary itself
- using embed we can access the files like a file system
- the //go:embed <path></path> directive must be used on a package level,
  not inside any func or method
- <path> should be relative to the file containing the //go:embed 
- root of this filesystem is the file/folder containing //go:embed, path
  cannot contain . or .. or end with /. This means we can only embed files 
  in the same directory(or sub directory) as the file containg //go:embed 
- If <path> is a folder then all files in the folder and its subfolders are
  recursively embedded 
- We can specify multiple folders and files in one directive(//go:embed) like 
  //go:embed "images" "styles/css" "favicon.ico"
- Path should always be a forward slash, even on Windows

Background routines:
- in our registerUser Handler, we have a background go routine to send welcome
  emails. It is a simple go routine but it is a closure, it uses "app" Handler.
- even thoough our HandlerFunc will return before the routine executes fully, any 
  changes made to the closed over variables (like app) will be reflected throughout 
  our application
- also if there are any panics, even in the background go routine, the entire api 
  will shutdown. So it is important to use revocer() to recover from panics if any 
  Here we will just log the err that recover() returns

Authentication:
- 401 Unauthorised for when you have missing or bad Authentication
- 403 Forbidden for when user is authenticated but doesn't have permission for this action
